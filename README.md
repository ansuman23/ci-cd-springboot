# Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD on AWS, Terraform and AWS DevOps üöÄ

## Project Overview üìù
This project demonstrates a **Java Spring Boot** application integrated with **Swagger API** documentation, containerized using **Docker**, deployed on **Kubernetes**, and automated with a complete **CI/CD pipeline** on **AWS** using **CodePipeline**, **CodeBuild**, **CodeDeploy**, and **Amazon EKS**.

Key Features:
- **Spring Boot** app with Swagger API docs
- **Docker** for containerization of the application
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration
- **CI/CD** automation with **AWS services** (CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, EKS)
- **Docker Hub** as the container registry
- Full integration with **AWS Lambda** for serverless functionality (optional)

## Project Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

### 1. Clone the repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/springboot-docker-kubernetes.git
cd springboot-docker-kubernetes
```

### 2. Build the Spring Boot Application
Use **Maven** to build the Spring Boot app:
```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

### 3. Dockerize the Application üê≥
Docker is used to package the application into a container for easy deployment and scaling.

- **Dockerfile**: A Dockerfile defines the environment to run your Spring Boot application.
  ```Dockerfile
  FROM tomcat:9.0.85-jdk17
  WORKDIR /user/local/tomcat/webapps/
  COPY target/expense-tracker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war expense-tracker.war
  EXPOSE 8081
  CMD ["catalina.sh","run"]
  ```

- **Build Docker Image**:
  ```bash
  docker build -t your-username/springboot-app .
  ```

- **Push Docker Image to Docker Hub**:
  ```bash
  docker push your-username/springboot-app
  ```

## Technologies Used ‚ö°

### Java Spring Boot üñ•Ô∏è
A popular Java framework for building stand-alone, production-grade web applications. It simplifies the development of RESTful APIs.

### Docker üêã
Docker containers package the application and its dependencies into a portable unit, ensuring consistent runtime across environments.

### Kubernetes üî≤
Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides high availability, scalability, and easy rollback features for your applications.

### AWS CI/CD üå©Ô∏è
AWS services like **CodePipeline**, **CodeBuild**, and **CodeDeploy** automate the build, test, and deployment process, ensuring faster and error-free releases.

### Swagger üìö
Swagger is used for generating interactive API documentation, allowing users to easily test and understand the API endpoints.

### AWS Lambda ‚ö°
AWS Lambda allows you to run serverless functions in response to events, reducing the need for managing servers.

## Setup Instructions üîß

### Docker Setup üêã
**Dockerize the application** to create a containerized version of the Spring Boot app, which can be deployed consistently across environments.

1. **Create Dockerfile**:
   Define the base image, copy the application JAR, and set the entry point.
   ```Dockerfile
    FROM tomcat:9.0.85-jdk17
    WORKDIR /user/local/tomcat/webapps/
    COPY target/expense-tracker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war expense-tracker.war
    EXPOSE 8081
    CMD ["catalina.sh","run"]
   ```

2. **Build Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-username/springboot-app .
   ```

3. **Push Image to Docker Hub**:
   ```bash
   docker push your-username/springboot-app
   ```

### Kubernetes Setup üî≤
**Kubernetes** helps manage the containerized application with features like auto-scaling, high availability, and rolling updates.

1. **Create Kubernetes Deployment**: Use `deployment.yaml` for specifying how many pods you need and the container to run.
   Example `deployment.yaml`
   ```
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: expense-tracker-deployment
    spec:
      replicas: 2
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: expense-tracker
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: expense-tracker
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: expense-tracker
              image: ansuman25/expense-tracker:1.0
              ports:
                - containerPort: 8081
   ```

3. **Create Kubernetes Service**: Expose the app with a `service.yaml` to make it accessible via a LoadBalancer.
   Example `service.yaml`
   ```
   apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: expense-tracker-service
    spec:
      type: NodePort
      selector:
        app: expense-tracker
      ports:
        - port: 8081
          targetPort: 8081
          nodePort: 30081
   ```

### AWS CI/CD Pipeline üîÑ
Set up **CI/CD** pipelines using AWS services for automating the entire process of code deployment.

1. **CodePipeline**: Integrates with GitHub for continuous integration and AWS services for deployment.
2. **CodeBuild**: Automatically builds Docker images and pushes them to **Docker Hub**.
3. **CodeDeploy**: Deploys the Docker container on **Amazon EKS**.

Example **buildspec.yml** for AWS CodeBuild:
```
version: 0.2

phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Skipping Docker build, image is already in Docker Hub.

artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
```
---
## Deployment üì¶

**Deploy to Amazon EKS**:
   - Set up an **Amazon EKS** cluster and configure `kubectl` to interact with it.
   - Use the following commands to deploy:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
     kubectl apply -f service.yaml
     ```

**‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy to Amazon S3 (Static Files or Lambda Package)**
- Create an S3 bucket to store your deployment files or host a static website.
- Use the following commands to upload your artifacts:
```bash

aws s3 mb s3://your-bucket-name
aws s3 cp lambda-function.zip s3://your-bucket-name/lambda-function.zip
aws lambda update-function-code \
  --function-name your-lambda-name \
  --s3-bucket your-bucket-name \
  --s3-key lambda-function.zip
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Terraform Deployment (for Web Scraper)
This project uses Terraform to automate the deployment of the Python web scraper to an AWS EC2 instance.

‚úÖ Purpose
Instead of running the scraper locally, Terraform provisions a virtual machine in the cloud, installs Python and dependencies, and runs the script automatically.

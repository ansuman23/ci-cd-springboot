# Java Spring Boot Project with Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD on AWS üöÄ

## Project Overview üìù
This project demonstrates a **Java Spring Boot** application integrated with **Swagger API** documentation, containerized using **Docker**, deployed on **Kubernetes**, and automated with a complete **CI/CD pipeline** on **AWS** using **CodePipeline**, **CodeBuild**, **CodeDeploy**, and **Amazon EKS**.

Key Features:
- **Spring Boot** app with Swagger API docs
- **Docker** for containerization of the application
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration
- **CI/CD** automation with **AWS services** (CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, EKS)
- **Docker Hub** as the container registry
- Full integration with **AWS Lambda** for serverless functionality (optional)

## Project Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

### 1. Clone the repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/springboot-docker-kubernetes.git
cd springboot-docker-kubernetes
```

### 2. Build the Spring Boot Application
Use **Maven** to build the Spring Boot app:
```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

### 3. Dockerize the Application üê≥
Docker is used to package the application into a container for easy deployment and scaling.

- **Dockerfile**: A Dockerfile defines the environment to run your Spring Boot application.
  ```Dockerfile
  FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
  COPY target/springboot-app.jar app.jar
  ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
  ```

- **Build Docker Image**:
  ```bash
  docker build -t your-username/springboot-app .
  ```

- **Push Docker Image to Docker Hub**:
  ```bash
  docker push your-username/springboot-app
  ```

## Technologies Used ‚ö°

### Java Spring Boot üñ•Ô∏è
A popular Java framework for building stand-alone, production-grade web applications. It simplifies the development of RESTful APIs.

### Docker üêã
Docker containers package the application and its dependencies into a portable unit, ensuring consistent runtime across environments.

### Kubernetes üî≤
Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides high availability, scalability, and easy rollback features for your applications.

### AWS CI/CD üå©Ô∏è
AWS services like **CodePipeline**, **CodeBuild**, and **CodeDeploy** automate the build, test, and deployment process, ensuring faster and error-free releases.

### Swagger üìö
Swagger is used for generating interactive API documentation, allowing users to easily test and understand the API endpoints.

### AWS Lambda (optional) ‚ö°
AWS Lambda allows you to run serverless functions in response to events, reducing the need for managing servers.

## Setup Instructions üîß

### Docker Setup üêã
**Dockerize the application** to create a containerized version of the Spring Boot app, which can be deployed consistently across environments.

1. **Create Dockerfile**:
   Define the base image, copy the application JAR, and set the entry point.
   ```Dockerfile
   FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
   COPY target/springboot-app.jar app.jar
   ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
   ```

2. **Build Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-username/springboot-app .
   ```

3. **Push Image to Docker Hub**:
   ```bash
   docker push your-username/springboot-app
   ```

### Kubernetes Setup üî≤
**Kubernetes** helps manage the containerized application with features like auto-scaling, high availability, and rolling updates.

1. **Create Kubernetes Deployment**: Use `deployment.yaml` for specifying how many pods you need and the container to run.
   Example `deployment.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: springboot-app-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 2
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: springboot-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: springboot-app
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: springboot-app
           image: your-username/springboot-app
           ports:
           - containerPort: 8080
   ```

2. **Create Kubernetes Service**: Expose the app with a `service.yaml` to make it accessible via a LoadBalancer.
   Example `service.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: springboot-app-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: springboot-app
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 8080
     type: LoadBalancer
   ```

### AWS CI/CD Pipeline üîÑ
Set up **CI/CD** pipelines using AWS services for automating the entire process of code deployment.

1. **CodePipeline**: Integrates with GitHub for continuous integration and AWS services for deployment.
2. **CodeBuild**: Automatically builds Docker images and pushes them to **Docker Hub**.
3. **CodeDeploy**: Deploys the Docker container on **Amazon EKS**.

Example **buildspec.yml** for AWS CodeBuild:
```yaml
version: 0.2
phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - echo Installing dependencies...
      - apt-get update -y
      - apt-get install -y docker.io
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Building Docker image...
      - docker build -t your-username/springboot-app .
      - docker push your-username/springboot-app
```

---

## Deployment üì¶

1. **Deploy to Amazon EKS**:
   - Set up an **Amazon EKS** cluster and configure `kubectl` to interact with it.
   - Use the following commands to deploy:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
     kubectl apply -f service.yaml
     ```

2. **Access the Application**:
   Once the deployment is successful, access the app through the LoadBalancer URL provided by Kubernetes.
